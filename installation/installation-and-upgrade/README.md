&#x20;We no longer support 32-bit platforms; hence we only support ARM64 and AMD64. Find out why [here](https://officialaptivi.wordpress.com/2024/08/03/final-word-regarding-32-bit-support/).

It's a good practice to verify that your download is not corrupt using the methods outlined in the [Attestations](https://app.gitbook.com/s/Id4bob6wnHvpX4zbVVtI/csharp-libraries/attestations) page.
