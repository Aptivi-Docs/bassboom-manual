# Using Basolia

Usage of the Basolia library may not look easy at first, but they will look easy once you get used to it and its syntax.

This allows you to initialize the Basolia library either using your default executable directory or using your customized directory that contains the `runtimes` folder that contains the mpg123 libraries, such as in the case of Nitrocid.BassBoom addon.

This is an easy way to create a new instance of `BasoliaMedia`.

{% code title="Somewhere in your code" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
basoliaMedia = new BasoliaMedia();
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to be able to use BassBoom Basolia functions, you need to make a new instance of the `BasoliaMedia` class.

You'll need to give an instance of `BasoliaMedia` to the Basolia functions that require it.
