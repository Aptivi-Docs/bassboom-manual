# What is BassBoom?

BassBoom aims to be a cross-platform music player that allows you to play MP3 files from any hard drive installed on your computer, your phone, or on your tablet.

BassBoom CLI is a music player that uses the Basolia library as the backend, with Terminaux as the backend for display.

Additionally, BassBoom provides you with its own backend library, Basolia, which handles all the heavy-lifting for playing music. It also provides a safe API for playing music, getting metadata information, and so on.
