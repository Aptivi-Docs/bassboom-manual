# ðŸŽ¶ BassBoom CLI

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/BB.Cli.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

BassBoom provides you its CLI version that allows you to play any music using just your terminal emulator. You can use this version if you need no GUI and just want to play music using just the textual UI.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since the TUI version uses Terminaux to render its elements, you need to have a terminal emulator which supports VT sequences out of the box.
{% endhint %}

## Usage

You can run this program by either double-clicking an executable file, which will prompt you for the full path to a music file, or by opening the command prompt to the BassBoom.Cli binaries directory and writing the command like this:

* For Windows, `BassBoom.Cli.exe path/to/music.mp3`
* For Linux, `dotnet BassBoom.Cli.dll path/to/music.mp3`

Once done, BassBoom opens your music file to be ready for playing. Just play your music by pressing the spacebar.

## Controls

You can use the following keys to navigate through the entire music player. However, there are keys that don't do anything in modes that don't define such keys.

### Idle mode
